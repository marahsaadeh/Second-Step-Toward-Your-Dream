# Second-Step-Toward-Your-Dream

This project solves several programming questions using the **Dart** language. It shows how to use variables, logical conditions, type conversions, lists, sets, maps, and mathematical operations.

### Explanation of Each Task

#### **Question 1:**

I wrote a program that takes (assigns) two numbers and checks some conditions using `&&` and `||`, like checking if one number is odd and the other is even, or if both numbers are positive. I used `++` and `--` to increase and decrease the numbers. I also changed one result to an integer with `toInt()`. I used the bitwise NOT `~` operator, and printed if the first number (after increment) is greater than the second (after decrement) using a conditional operator.

#### **Question 2:**

I made a function that takes a double number and prints its ceiling, floor, and rounded values. The function also turns the number into a string and combines it with a name. I used a conditional operator to print "Large" if the number is more than 10, and "Small" if it is 10 or less.

#### **Question 3:**

I created a constant list, changed it to a set, and added a new value. Then I made a map where the keys are the set elements and the values are the numbers multiplied by 3. Finally, I printed the map.

#### **Question 4:**

I wrote a program that reads a number of days and changes it to years, months, and days (1 year = 365 days, 1 month = 30 days). The program prints all results in a clear way like the sample output.

### Why did I choose these solutions?

* I made sure to use all operators and requirements from the questions to show my understanding of logical and mathematical operations in Dart.
* I used type conversions, sets, and maps to practice data structures.
* I added comments and clear steps in the code to make it easy to read.
* I kept the code clean and organized for easier maintenance.
